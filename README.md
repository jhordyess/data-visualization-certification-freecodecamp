# Data Visualization Certification

This repository showcases my completed projects for the Data Visualization Certification from freeCodeCamp. The certification focuses on building interactive data visualizations using D3.js, working with JSON data, and utilizing APIs.

## Projects

The certification consists of the following 5 Data Visualization projects:

1. [Bar Chart Visualization](https://jhordyess.github.io/data-visualization-certification/bar-chart/): Visualize the United States GDP from 1947 to 2015 using a bar chart.
2. [Scatterplot Graph Visualization](https://jhordyess.github.io/data-visualization-certification/scatterplot-graph/): Explore doping in Professional Bicycle Racing(Alpe d'Huez) from 1994 to 2015 through a scatterplot graph.
3. [Heat Map Visualization](https://jhordyess.github.io/data-visualization-certification/heat-map/): Examine monthly Global Land-Surface Temperature from 1753 to 2015 using a heat map.
4. [Choropleth Map Visualization](./choropleth-map/): Visualize the percentage of adults age 25 and older with a bachelor's degree or higher (2010-2014) using a choropleth map.
5. [Treemap Diagram Visualization](./treemap-diagram/): Display the Top 100's Video Game Sales, Movie Sales, and Kickstarter Pledges using a treemap diagram.
