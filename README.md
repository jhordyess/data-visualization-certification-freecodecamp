# Data Visualization Certification

This repository showcases my completed projects for the Data Visualization Certification from freeCodeCamp. The certification focuses on building interactive data visualizations using D3.js, working with JSON data, and utilizing APIs.

## Projects

The certification consists of the following 5 Data Visualization projects:

1. [Bar Chart Visualization](https://jhordyess.github.io/data-visualization-certification/bar-chart/): Visualize the United States GDP from 1947 to 2015 using a bar chart.
